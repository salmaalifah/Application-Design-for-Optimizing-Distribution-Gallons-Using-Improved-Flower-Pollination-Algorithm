My Thesis Project, Application Design for Optimizing The Distribution Of Mineral Water Gallons Using Improved Flower Pollination Algorithm. This project implements an  optimization model in web application. Mostly use native PHP to make an optimization model, visualization map use GCP for library Maps API, and use CPanel for hosting.
